#### Description/Features: 
This is the first app I've built that taps into a database allowing for all CRUD operations to be performed. It displays a list of books and lets the user add new books, update the book information, or delete the book from the database all together. The SQL ORM Sequelize is used for all database interaction.

### To launch: 
run npm install to install project dependencies
run nodemon or npm start
view on localhost:3000

## Built With:
**HTML**
